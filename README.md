## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your machine.

## Meet The Team Setup

The About page now includes a Supabase-backed team section. To populate it:

1. Run the SQL in [supabase/team_members_setup.sql](supabase/team_members_setup.sql) inside the Supabase SQL editor.
2. Create a public storage bucket named `team-images` if it is not created by the script.
3. Upload each team photo into the `team-images` bucket using the file names referenced in the SQL seed data, or update the `image_path` values to match your uploaded names.
4. Keep `is_active` set to `true` for profiles that should appear on the About page.
5. Use `sort_order` to control the display order on the page.

The app derives public image URLs from Supabase Storage at render time, so only the storage path is stored in the `team_members` table.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/open-shore-studios.git](https://github.com/your-username/open-shore-studios.git)
cd open-shore-studios
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
